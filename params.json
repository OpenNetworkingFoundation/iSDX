  "body": "### Welcome to the iSDX Website on the Open Source SDN GitHub (link to full repo included below) \r\n\r\niSDX (Software-Defined IXP) Software brings the merits of SDN to interdomain routing. Today’s networks can only forward traffic based on the destination IP prefixes and routes offered by their immediate neighbors. SDN can give direct control over packet-processing rules that match on multiple header fields and perform a variety of actions. \r\n\r\nIXPs are a compelling place to deploy these changes, given their role in interconnecting many networks and their growing importance in bringing popular content closer to end users.\r\n\r\nSDX does more than simply replace an IXP’s switches with their OpenFlow counterparts. iSDX's capabilities enable new applications, such as application-specific peering---where two networks peer only for (say) streaming video traffic. We also developed new programming abstractions that allow participating networks to create and run these applications and a runtime that both behaves correctly when interacting with BGP and ensures that applications do not interfere with each other. Finally, we also ensured that the system scales, both in terms of table size and computational overhead.\r\n\r\nWe are involved in several trial deployments of the iSDX controller at various IXPs around the world, in collaboration with network operators.\r\n\r\n# PROJECT SUMMARY  \r\n\r\nProject Leader:\tArpit Gupta, Princeton University\r\n\r\nLicense: Open Source SDN/Apache 2.0/All documents Creative Commons 4.0 BY\r\n\r\nSoftware Language(s): Python, Java\r\n\r\nCommunity Information:\thttps://community.opensourcesdn.org/wg/iSDX/dashboard\r\n\r\nLocation of Project: Text: http://sdx.cs.princeton.edu/ ; Code: https://github.com/sdn-ixp\r\n\r\nGovernance: http://opensourcesdn.org/governance/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
